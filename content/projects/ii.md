Sensing the user

Iterating upon Folder View, Dynamic Desktop, Provider Browser and the Tag Based File Management, I worked out an idea of a new user interface. In the system, the Information Interface, files and other technical remnants of OS-history are removed from the interface. The data lives in the OS - not in different programs - so the different types of data are easier to share and relate.

​

Central in the interface and OS are objects like ‘task’, ‘minutes’, ‘Product A’; not files, programs and folders. The user can use tags to make the distinction between a family photo and e.g. a press photo. In the current system, you can select a template of e.g. a Curriculum Vitae or a Brochure in a word processor But after selecting that, the system forgets what the user wants to create and handles the input just like any other document/file. This is a waste of information. There are many more examples. Why does the system forget the sender of e-mail attachment when the file is saved and used in another program? It could very well be useful.

The Information Interface automatically gathers this metadata and the software benefits because it ‘knows’ what project the user is working on, where the file came from, and eventually, who to send it back to. If it’s a business project, it makes no sense to show family photos for example.

​

I created this a couple of years ago and iterated on the design. It will use standards like RDF, Microformats, Opengraph, Dublin Core. It could very useful, especially with the gathering of metadata in for example an internet OS.
