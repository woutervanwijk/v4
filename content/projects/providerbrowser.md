Dynamic UI

Provider Browser is a piece of software which I built in 2001-2002. It was the result of an attempt to build the first Information Interface and evolved into a piece of software which can dynamically create user-interfaces from small (downloadable) XML-files.

I used it for quick mock ups or for use as a browser or a file manager. ​The system used a tabbed-interface for browsing and a dedicated search box, way before it was put in the mainstream browsers.
