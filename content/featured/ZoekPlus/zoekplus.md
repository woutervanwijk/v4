Beyond Google

In 2010 I created a Dutch website, zoekplus.nl, to make searching beyond Google easier.
​
No matter how good Google is, sometimes a dedicated niche-engine is better to find out things, I discovered as a journalist.
​
This site makes it a lot easier for novice users to search the web using multiple engines. It’s used by journalists and in schools as an education tool.

The UI is not advanced - it just works - but it's much cleaner than most sites that offer access to multiple search engines. I tried to integrate the results in one screen, but that was too much for my spare time...
