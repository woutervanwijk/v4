Menus on MSX

Even when I was starting to program in the late eighties (in Basic on the MSX homecomputer) I tried to make it more easy to use.

This is a screenshot of a menu program for game disks which was -for that time- quite advanced. It used a graphical screen and a custom font, multiple pages and icons to indicate what was needed to start a game.

Because it was used to start mostly games, you could move the selection arrow using a joystick, which was quite uncommon for menu software at that time.
