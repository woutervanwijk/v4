Forget C:\ and Folders

I have always been intrigued by the clumsiness of the file system. As a way to store and retrieve data, it's backward.

When brainstorming about ways to make Folder View better, I realized that the tags and categories of blogs could be a nice way to file documents, photo's and other files on a traditional computer.

I redesigned the open/save dialogs and the file explorer to use tags instead of the traditional file system. I did not start programming it, because that would take too much time, but created a document (pdf) which describes it.
