For my Yahoo! browser, an example I built in 2000/2001 to prove the concept of Provider Browser, I included a search box in the top right corner of the GUI.

With it, you could search Yahoo right from the browser interface. Just like the search boxes the mainstream browsers added a couple of years later.
