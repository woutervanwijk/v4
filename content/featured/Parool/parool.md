New newssites

At the two newspapers I worked for, I helped redesign the newssites. AtÂ www.parool.nl (newspaper for Amsterdam) and www.ad.nl (busy site of the second largest newspaper of the Netherlands). We worked with a team of journalists, coders, designers to create the new designs and user experiences. Both sites have changed a lot since then btw.

The designs were fairly standard with header on top, navigation at the left side, content in the center. Unique was the three panel layout for parool.nl we dreamed up in 1999: one for navigation, one for the newspaper/journalist content, one for user generated content. Me and my fellow journalist in the development team really wanted that.
