Easy Softwareâ€‹

Commercially, I developed a couple software packages which me and my (student) business partner sold for our own company, DaVinci Media.

The most successful one was EasyScore, an easy to use package which simplified the process of getting the many results of sporting competitions into the newspaper. I had a parttime job to process the competitions of amateur sports for a newspaper. I used a database, but I got paid as if I was doing it by hand :-) Out of this database, EasyScore grew.

In the end we had a lot of Dutch newspapers as clients.
