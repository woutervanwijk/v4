Dynamic Desktop lets the user switch between different folders ('projects') on the desktop. I found out that I couldn't really 'unclutter' it the way I wanted withoutÂ getting really deep into the Windows system.

The software has been referenced in a [patent application of AOL](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7603629.html), America Online, because of the dynamic icons on the desktop.
