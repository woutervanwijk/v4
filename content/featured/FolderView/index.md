Access to folders

Folder View also started with an itch. As a journalist I had to ​use a lot of different local and networked folders.

​

At the time, Windows XP didn’t have the sidebar with folders which Windows 7 has now, so you had to click a lot to reach your most used folders in Explorer and in the Open/Save dialog windows of applications.

​

After some iterations, Folder View became a tool which got a lot of great reviews in magazines and on software sites at the time.
