Thunderbird in a browser

In 2004 I realized that you could implement a traditional email-client like Mozilla Thunderbird as a web application, so it could be run entirely from a web server.

I succeeded by using a javascript technology which later became known as Ajax. It used PHP on the server and the XUL interface language of Mozilla (Firefox) as the UI.

Based on this project, I helped the commercial @mail webclient to work in this way.
